# Amiga Future Composer 1.4 Replay Routine

- refactored and fixed (original version doesn't play properly when registers are changed between calls)
- optimized (not much but about 1 raster line is won)
- tested with vasm and asm-two
- playback example using copper interrupt and raster time shown + equalizers + menu selector
